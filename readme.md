# 2q.js coming soon
2q.js is a DOM tool coming sometime to replace q.js in my future projects.

# Why 2q.js?
q.js is awesome for me and makes my development much faster and enjoyable.
2q.js aims to be quicker and better, especially making it more uniform and readable.

<sub><sup>q stands for quick, so too-quick.js. Thanks for checking it out.</sup></sub>
