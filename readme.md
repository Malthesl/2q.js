# 2q.js
2q.js is a tool I use to make elements dynamically in JS without multiple lines of createElement, set content, styles, appending them to a parent and so forth.

Similar functionallity looks like this in 2q.js: `document.body.q('img.big-image', {src: 'myimage.png'})`

This tool is still in development, and as I find bugs and come up with features, I fix and add them as needed. If you find a bug or have a feature request, just make an Issue.
