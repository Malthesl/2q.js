# 2q.js coming soon
2q.js is a DOM tool coming sometime to replace q.js in my future projects.

Not complete! --- Still being tested and changing!

# Why 2q.js?
q.js is an awesome tool for me and makes my development much faster and enjoyable.

2q.js aims to be quicker and better, especially making it more uniform and readable than q.js.

See the full docs in the wiki.

<sub><sup>q stands for quick, so too-quick.js. Thanks for checking it out.</sup></sub>
